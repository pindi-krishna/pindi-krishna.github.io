My “database” of information on <em><a href="https://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/what-giftedness" target="_blank">intellectual giftedness</a></em> (termed <em><a href="https://dorsch.hogrefe.com/stichwort/hochbegabung-intellektuelle" target="_blank">Hochbegabung</a></em> in German) – I first started looking into this concept when I wrote a literature review on giftedness and academic achievement in my undergrad. As I noticed that it’s rather hard to make sense of the research literature and the many differing definitions, I thought it would be worthwhile to try and make the information more accessible and comprehensible for others by building a structured resource collection. As I’m from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the said database also includes relevant information in German.

For the sake of accessibility, I store this information on an external page – you can either <a href="https://www.notion.so/Giftedness-Resources-9fbf01dc85794104b52e6d45797ee684" target="_blank">
