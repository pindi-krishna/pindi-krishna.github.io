I recently started building <a href="https://jet-shawl-461.notion.site/Resources-for-Aspiring-PhD-Doctoral-Students-33036c91be8149398751b7bc200e6a9d" target="_blank">a resource collection all around pursuing a PhD</a>. Since I myself study Psychology in Europe, that is what the information is primarily centered around (if you’re a US student reading this, I’m sorry…). However, it does contain a few parts that apply to the general population of students (e.g., what does one do in a PhD, and where to look for relevant positions?).
