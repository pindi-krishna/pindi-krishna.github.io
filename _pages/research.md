    <h5>Development of Scientific Reasoning during Childhood</h5>
    
    <div class="projecttext">
      In recent decades, the child development literature has brought forward an increasing number of accounts of children's remarkable hypothesis testing, experimentation, and evidence evaluation skills (see e.g., <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1223416" target="_blank">Gopnik, 2012</a>; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcs.1580" target="_blank">Lapidow & Walker, 2021</a>, for reviews).<br>
      <br>
      The research group of <a href="https://www.psy.lmu.de/epp/personen/professoren/sodian/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Beate Sodian</a>, which I joined at the beginning of this year, has recently completed a longitudinal study as well as multiple experimental studies on the development of such knowledge seeking processes in children between the ages of 4 and 8. I'm presently assisting with analyzing and interpreting the data. You can visit the project website below to read more!<br>

    <h5>Social Learning and Imperfect Advice</h5>
    
    <div class="projecttext">
      Building on the work of Natalia Vélez & Hyowon Gweon (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12388" target="_blank">this paper</a>), I'm currently working on an experimental study that investigates how people learn from and use (imperfect) advice to inform their decision-making.<br>
      <br>
      The project is supervised by <a href="http://www2.psy.unsw.edu.au/users/cdonkin/home.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Christopher Donkin</a>. More information will follow soon!

    <h5>Self-Regulated Learning in a Science Museum</h5>
    
    <div class="projecttext">
      Between November 2021 and August 2022, I assisted with a <a href="https://www.edu.sot.tum.de/en/fil/team/" target="_blank">research project at TUM</a> that investigates how German high school students' self-regulated learning in a museum context can be supported with instructional prompts of various kinds.<br>
      <br>
      The project is conducted in collaboration with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Museum" target="_blank">Deutsches Museum</a>, one of the largest museums of science and technology worldwide! You can click the link below to read more.

    <h5>Improving the Need for Cognition Scale</h5>
    
    <div class="projecttext">
      The Need for Cognition (NFC) scale measures people's tendency and desire to engage in difficult cognitive activity. Caccioppo et al.'s (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327752jpa4803_13" target="_blank">1984</a>) 18-item scale is quite well established. Coelho et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1073191118793208" target="_blank">2018</a>) have recently proposed and tested a 6-item version.
      <br><br>
      As part of a graduate class on factor and item analysis, a few fellow students and I set out to improve the wording and structure of the items in said scale.<br><br>
      More information will follow once our analyses have been concluded!

    <h5>(Digital) Media Use of Children in Switzerland</h5>
    
    <div class="projecttext">
      The <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/psychology/research/media-psychology/" target="_blank">Media Psychology Group</a> at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (<a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/" target="_blank">ZHAW</a>) conducts nationwide research on the (digital) media use of local school children with their biennial <em><a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/psychology/research/media-psychology/media-use/mike/" target="_blank">MIKE</a></em>- and <em><a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/psychology/research/media-psychology/media-use/james/" target="_blank">JAMES</a></em>-studies.<br><br>
      During my research internship with the group, I analysed data from one of its most recent studies conducted with elementary school students.<br><br>

      During my research internship at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>, I worked on a project investigating the link between math achievement and math-gender stereotypes in Swiss elementary school students.<br><br>
      The results of the study are not yet published, but you can find more information through the links below.

    <h5>Cognitive, Perceptual, and Attentional Skills of Gamers</h5>
    
    <div class="projecttext">
      League of Legends (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends" target="_blank">LoL</a>) counts among the most popular video game titles in the world. Not only does its rapid pace and action-filled content make for fun game play, it also places a high demand on the players’ cognition, perception and attention. For my undergraduate thesis, I investigated in what way playing such a game is associated with increases in select cognitive, perceptual, and attentional skills.
      Over 300 people ended up participating in my study, and the data did indeed show LoL players outperforming non-gamers in visual search as well as simple and complex reaction time.<br><br>
      However, perhaps the biggest question on the (cognitive) benefits of video game play is to what extent they generalize beyond computerized tasks and tests. If you are curious to read more, Bediou et al. (<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fbul0000130" target="_blank">2018</a>) and Sala et al. (<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fbul0000139" target="_blank">2018</a>) might be good place to start.<br><br>
      Furthermore, you can find a (quite old) PDF with a summary of my bachelor thesis below.
