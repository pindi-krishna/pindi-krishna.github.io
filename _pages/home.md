I’m a master’s student in Computer Science and Engineering at the <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in"> Internatioal Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad</a> (IIITH). Here at IIITH, I work under  <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/Bapiraju/"> Dr. Bapi Raju </a> in Cognitive Science Lab.


I’m a passionate researcher and a problem solver, having experience developing Deep Learning models for various applications. I am a Mathematics enthusiast. I am very excited to work on projects which have the potential to contribute to the community significantly.


I’m willing to work towards providing machine learning-based solutions for day-to-day activities. I possess a strong foundation in  Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Machine Learning Algorithms, and Computer Vision. My areas of interest: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. I am very much excited to explore new aspects of that.


I would love to collaborate with researchers interested in Computer Vision and NLP. I’m actively looking for research and engineer profile jobs in Deep Learning, Computer vision, and Natural Language Processing. Please let me know if there is an opportunity, and don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:krishna.chandra@research.iiit.ac.in">reach out for anything!</a><br><br> .
