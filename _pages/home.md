I'm currently a <b>master's student in Psychology and Learning Sciences</b> at <a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/about-lmu/index.html">Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München</a> (LMU Munich).

I’m <b>interested in how children come to understand and obtain knowledge about the world</b>, including the functions of <b>curiosity, inquiry, and playful exploration</b> in their knowledge-seeking processes.

Relatedly, I’m passionate about finding ways to design and facilitate effective, engaging, and personalized learning experiences for young students, especially to <b>foster their curiosity and early scientific literacy</b>.

In my free time, I sometimes <a href="/writings/">blog</a> and dabble in small <a href="https://github.com/adaniabutto">webdesign / data viz / miscellaneous coding projects</a>. I always enjoy exchanging ideas with others, so please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:adaniabutto@gmail.com">reach out!</a><br><br>
