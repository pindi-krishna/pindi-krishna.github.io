In my own schooling, frustration ensued early: I felt that I had to sit still, keep quiet, listen, and focus on just one subject at a time. However, this conflicted with my desire to ask questions as they came up, and to understand how various topics connected. Fortunately, at home, I soon discovered the internet and the world of computers: My pent-up curiosity could run free on Wikipedia and in niche interest forums, as my questions were always welcome here. Before I knew it, I started skipping homework and studying to instead spend more time online, gradually reducing my academic efforts to a minimum. Although my school eventually noticed my disengagement, allowing me to skip a grade and enter an accelerated program, it was already too late by then; the virtual world had taken over as my preferred place for learning, and henceforth, the classroom content could never again measure up to it. I took a particular liking to computer games due to their captivating storylines, exciting visuals, and seemingly endless supply of levels (I even played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends" target="_blank">League of Legends</a> competitively for a while!)

I eventually graduated from high school in 2016, disappointed with my twelve years of formal education. I enlisted for civilian service, determined to serve in schools to help provide children with the learning experiences my younger self had wished for. I first went to teach at a special education school, . As my time teaching came to an end, I concluded that my main interest lay not in educating but more broadly in how children developed in their learning and thinking. Hence, I completed the rest of my civilian service as a childcare worker at the daycare center. In contrasting this more playful environment with formal education, I came to wonder: As children enter school, why is there a shift away from facilitating active inquiry and exploration, instead positioning them as passive recipients of knowledge for much of the time? Did this not make for a clear mismatch between children’s minds and school?

I interpreted these questions as a case for Psychology, the study of human thought and behavior, and enrolled in a bachelor’s program in Applied Psychology. My first year was challenging, as I lacked basic study skills and also juggled part-time jobs to fund my studies. I could not turn to my family for advice either, given I was the first of us to go to university. Still, my growing fascination with the subject kept me going, and I did better every month. However, in learning about psychology’s subdisciplines, I struggled to identify which investigated the mismatch between children’s minds and school—was it cognitive, developmental, differential, neurocognitive psychology, or even psychometrics? I went on to use the remainder of my undergraduate years as a broad exploration phase, dabbling in student assessment as a university entrance exam administrator, going on exchange to take courses in cognitive neuroscience, interning in educational research and media psychology, and completing my thesis on the potential link between video game play and enhanced cognitive skills.

As my studies drew to an end, I realized there was no single best-fitting field for me, but that to study children’s minds, the key lay in synthesizing ideas and methods from cognition, pedagogy, child development, instructional design, and adjacent areas. Then, being a research intern at ETH Zurich in my last semester, I was introduced to the Learning Sciences, a research community leveraging exactly this interdisciplinary approach to investigate and enhance human learning. I was hooked and started searching for Learning Sciences master’s programs at once. LMU Munich with its well-established program and strong research orientation ended up my first choice, and in September 2021, I commenced my studies in Germany.

In my first semester in Munich, I took a graduate course on cognitive development with Prof. Beate Sodian. Here, I encountered the literature characterizing children as “little scientists” for the very first time. I was blown away—there was all this research investigating children’s minds, using creative yet rigorous research methods, and its conclusions seemed to mirror what I had observed in working with kids! I swiftly applied to join Prof. Sodian’s research group as an intern, where I am still working today. My enjoyment working on this project has convinced me that I want to continue doing research with children, focusing on the drivers and mechanisms of their learning, and in what ways these can be enriched.

I consider myself very fortunate that observing and thinking about how children's minds work is now my profession!

In my free time, I like to wander around cities and go on hikes, take deep dives into whatever topic piques my curiosity and write up what I learned, play chess (terribly), and even play some video games whenever I feel particularly nostalgic!
